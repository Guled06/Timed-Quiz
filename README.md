<h1> INTRODUCTION</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<p>This application was designed using Javascript to manipulate the DOM (Data Object Model). It was designed for the users of this application to take a timed quiz.</p>
<br>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<p>This application was designed to let users take a timed quiz. In the timed quiz, this application should ideally store the scores of each user in localstorage. This was the idea, so that the user can gauge his progress compared to previous users who have taken the timed quiz.</p>
<br>
<h1>My Background</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<p>This was my second time in working with Javascript during my experience at the UCSD Triology Coding Bootcamp. This was a homework assignment designed for each student to complete the homework assignment on his/her own, with the help of his/her tutor and other resources that are available. You can review my previous Javascript application that I completed <a src="https://guled06.github.io/Password-Generator/">HERE</a>. In my previous project/assignment, I designed an application that allowed the user to generate a random password using lowercase and uppercase letter, numbers and special characters.</p>
